Saudi Arabia wants to buy 80% of Newcastle United Football Club. Buying Newcastle is part of its plan to make itself look good despite its disgraceful human rights record and leading role in the world's addiction to oil.

I'm a Newcastle fan. I'm appalled by the idea of Saudi Arabia buying the club.

People are understandably desperate to get rid of Mike Ashley and move on to a different owner. I am too.

But the reasons, the whataboutery, some people are using to make it seem like it's fine for Saudi Arabia to own the club are getting ridiculous.

Ultimately, countries should not buy football clubs. Especially countries who abuse people like Saudi Arabia does.

We're unlikely to get to the point that football's authorities deal with this properly.

But let's not try to make ourselves feel better about Saudi Arabia buying Newcastle United by pointing out other bad things. Other things being bad does not stop the incredibly bad things Saudi Arabia does being worse.

Here is some of the whataboutery I've seen people engaging in over the last few days.

## 1. Whatabout Mike Ashley?

Yes. Mike Ashley is a bad boss. His company Sports Direct treats its workers terribly. Mike Ashley has treated the club terribly. But, unlike Saudi Arabia, Mike Ashley does not:

* behead people ^[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/26/saudi-arabia-criticised-over-executions-for-drug-offences]
* lead wars that kill civilians ^[https://www.amnesty.org.uk/exposed-british-made-bombs-used-civilian-targets-yemen]
* put people in prison for saying that men and women are equal ^[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-47553416]

## 2. Whatabout Saudi Arabia investing in other clubs?

This one is often followed up with something about how the media didn't cover Saudi Arabia having interest in other clubs.

Yes. It is bad that Saudi Arabia has invested indirectly in other clubs to try to improve its image.

And while we're here…Yes, it is also bad that Saudi Arabia paid social media influencers to go to a music festival in Saudi Arabia and [post about a 'cultural revolution'](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/23/shameless-influencers-face-backlash-for-promoting-saudi-arabia-music-festival).

Some people seem to think that anyone who criticises the Saudi takeover is holding Newcastle to a higher moral standard than other clubs. I don't fully understand why some people think this.

[Journalists have covered Saudi Arabia investing](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/15/sportswashing-europes-biggest-clubs-champions-league-owners-sponsors-uefa) or being interested in buying other clubs in the past. How else would any of us have heard about it happening if journalists had not covered it?

## 3. Whatabout the UK's arms sales to Saudi Arabia?

Yes. This is also very bad. The UK should not sell arms to Saudi Arabia. That Saudi Arabia buys so many arms for its war in Yemen is a reason why Newcastle United should not be involved with them.

## 4. Whatabout the fans? Don’t they deserve some success?

It would be great for Newcastle to have success. Supporting Newcastle under Mike Ashley has often been rubbish. But if Newcastle does have success using Saudi Arabia's money, it will be hollow.

Sidenote: Does any team actually *deserve* success more or less than other teams?
