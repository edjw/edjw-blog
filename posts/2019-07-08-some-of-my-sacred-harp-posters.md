socialDescription: Some of my Sacred Harp poster designs
---

Over the last year, I've been designing posters for the [Durham Sacred Harp](https://durhamsacredharp.co.uk) singing. These are a few that I've made.

This one is very close the one that I printed up and put around town. There are a couple of small differences. If you haven't sung Sacred Harp before, then the logo at the top is alluding to [the hollow square arrangement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_Harp#Singing_Sacred_Harp_music) that Sacred Harp singers sit in. I've tried to prioritise a modern look and legibility of the copy.

This is a bookwrap with a similar design made landscape. It goes around the loaner books we give out to new singers.

These are a couple of designs that I kind of wimped out of getting printed and sticking up around town. I particularly like the first one. The shapes at the top are from [the shapenote notation system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_Harp#The_music_and_its_notation) that Sacred Harp uses.
