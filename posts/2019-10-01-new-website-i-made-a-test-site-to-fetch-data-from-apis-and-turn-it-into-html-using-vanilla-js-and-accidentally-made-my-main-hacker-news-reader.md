Title says it all. [Doug_hn_ut Reader is my main Hacker News reader](https://doughnut-reader.netlify.com) now. It's got a dark theme, works nicely on mobile, and is really fast. No tracking.

Have a look and let me know what you think. If you have a look at the code ([source on Github is here](https://github.com/edjw/hacker_news_reader)), you can see that I played for a long time with getting comments to appear on the site in a popup. It kind of worked but I couldn't get the multi-level comments to work well.
