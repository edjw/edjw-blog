I'm Ed Johnson-Williams. This is my personal blog. I'm also [on Twitter at @_edjw](https://twitter.com/_edjw).

I work at [Open Rights Group](https://openrightsgroup.org) researching ethics in Internet of Things development as well as issues around data protection, design, and user experience.

I sing [Sacred Harp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_Harp) and [other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Christian_Harmony) [shapenote music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_note).

I live in Durham in the north-east of England in the UK.
